Rocaloid is a vocal synthesis engine which originally aimed to enable Hatsune Miku to sing in Chinese (and maybe other languages).

The synthesis engine, CVE, currently uses time-domain algorism like PSOLA.

Sleepwalking called it "TDPSM" (Time Domain Pitch Synchronize and Mix).

We are planning to use [qtau] [1] as editor.

* Currently we are designing the new synthesis algorithm FECSOLA, which works on both Time and Freq Domain.
* The new Rocaloid will be written in C instead of C++.
* The whole project is going to be rewritten again...
* CVS, CDT, and RSC are also going to be redesigned.
* Multi sound db will be supported in the next version.

Rocaloid is a vocal synthesis engine which aims to enable Hatsune Miku to sing in Chinese (and maybe other languages).

The synthesis engine, CVE, currently uses time-domain algorism like PSOLA.
Sleepwalking called it "TDPSM" (Time Domain Pitch Synchronize and Mix).

For more information about Rocaloid, please visit http://bbs.ivocaloid.com/forum-138-1.html.

We are planning to use [qtau] [1] as editor.
